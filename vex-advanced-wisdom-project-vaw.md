# Mission Statement

After extensive discussion with many of the top tier VEXU programs, it became obvious that there is a gap in the ability to share knowledge among VRC and VEXU programs. The existing infrastructure that VEX has put out has been a fantastic resource for teams interested in getting into the field of robotics, but the introduction of VAIC has increased opportunities for both High School and University students to experiment with more advanced robotics techniques.

#### How are we achieving this goal?

With VAIC becoming a great experiment for all levels of the competition, it is incredibly helpful for teams that do not have the prerequisite background and experience to get involved with assistance from the highest level of university students who have all participated in the VEX Robotics Competition in both VEXU and VRC. Furthermore, we seek to centralize the wealth of information between generations of robotics students in one location.

The VEX community is one that is better together, we believe that the increased sharing of knowledge that is accessible to every team will bring about better robots and, most importantly, better engineers.

**Thank you,**
