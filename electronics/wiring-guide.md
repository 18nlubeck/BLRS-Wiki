## Wiring Basics - 

The V5 brain has 3 different types of ports - 20 motor ports \(labeled ports 1-21\), a single radio port \(port 21\), and 8 3 pin analog sensor ports \(labeled ports A-H\). 

Wiring from motors to brain ports is relatively simple compared to the legacy cortex system. Here's some tips when doing so - 

* Keep wires tight around robot arms to prevent loose wires getting snagged on other robots or other subsystems. 
  * Also, try to keep loose wires or wiring away from joints to prevent wires from being crushed by them.
  * Zipties/Cable ties are a good option for
* Wire lengths should be based on the maximum length that it needs to prevent wires from being stretched out by the robot itself.
  * You can do this by putting your robot to its full length before wiring.
* Labeling wires with their port numbers helps to keep wires organized in the case they need to replaced or moved around. 

## Wire Crimping:

Wire crimping allows teams to produce custom wire lengths and replace broken wires or wire heads. However, they can be to blame for dead ports if done incorrectly.
