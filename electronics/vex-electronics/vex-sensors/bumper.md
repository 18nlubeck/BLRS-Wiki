 The bumper switch is a pretty basic; in addition to being reliable and durable, it is easy to install and use. It falls into the category of “digital sensors,” meaning that it returns only two possible values: 1 or 0 \(and must be plugged into one of the cortex “digital” ports\).

Triggering it requires a reasonable amount of force, so don’t plan to use this for a movement that will lightly touch or graze its target object \(see next for limit switches to do that\).Last Author[baylessj](/p/baylessj/)Last EditedOct 13 2017, 11:45 PM
