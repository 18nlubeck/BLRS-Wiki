Catapults operate on very similar principles as [linear punchers](https://github.com/purduesigbots/BLRS-Wiki/tree/e1b6c623e7282b9401cee653be1052b957171a45/hardware/shooting-mechanisms/linear-punchers.md), but with rotational movement instead of linear.

An example system can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umryvVdB7sg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umryvVdB7sg)

The example shown above uses nautilus gears, but it is also quite easy to use shaved gears \(slipgears\) like on the linear puncher. Obviously with a catapult, normal gears would be used alongside the shaved pinion instead of rack gears.
