# Flip Out Mechanisms

A lot of times a robot will need to have a mechanism that "flips out", or expands outside of the 15 or 24 inch box at the start of the match. There are a few different ways to do this.

A lot of teams will make flip out mechanisms that are triggered by the robot's lift going up - it's fairly easy to hold something in place that moves horizontally with a lift, since the lift is constrained horizontally.

Starstruck was a game that required a flip-out mech for the popular claw design.Many flip out mechanisms were triggered by the claws opening. Similar use of the intake to trigger a flip out is good for other games too.
